# Cabinet — Pre-Release Product & UX Audit

**Auditor persona.** Top product + UX from Netflix, Meta, and the Claude team — wearing the same hat.
**Scope.** Web app served by `npm run dev:all` (Next.js + daemon, ports 4000 / 4100), build `0.3.4`, branch `dev/pre-release`, fresh boot on macOS, Chrome DevTools-driven walkthrough.
**Method.** Cold-boot the app, accept the disclaimer, walk every primary surface (Home, Editor, Agents, Tasks, Search, Settings, Terminal), capture screenshots, and read the network + console while clicking.
**Output.** This index + summary table at top, then one page per issue under `issues/` (134 total), grouped by area. Screenshots in `screenshots/`.

> This audit is **harsh on purpose**. The goal is to find every paper-cut and structural soft spot before a public release that will be judged in the first 5 minutes. Findings range from showstoppers to typography nitpicks; severity is called out per row.

## How to read this

- **Severity:** P0 (ship-blocker), P1 (high — fix before launch), P2 (medium — fix in next sprint), P3 (polish), P4 (nice-to-have).
- **Area:** BOOT, DISC (disclaimer/tour), HOME, NAV, EDIT, AG (agents), TASKS, SEARCH, SETT, STATUS, A11Y, PERF, COPY, SCHED, URL, MISC.
- **Type:** bug · UX · a11y · perf · copy · info-arch · branding.
- Each issue page has: observation, repro, recommendation, effort estimate, screenshot.

## Top 10 things I would fix this week

1. **#001** — `better-sqlite3` mismatch silently bricks the daemon when Node version drifts. Hard fail at boot, surface in UI.
2. **#008** — Disclaimer dismissal is not persistent — users re-sign every reload.
3. **#016** — GitHub stars badge flickers between three different values inside one navigation.
4. **#021** — Hash routes don't deep-link. Reloading a page URL drops the user on the homescreen.
5. **#038** — "Save failed" indicator sticks on the page even when there's nothing to save.
6. **#059** — Agent transcript concatenates sub-agent updates without line breaks — looks broken.
7. **#060** — Shell init line `running .zshenv 🌸` is leaking into agent output.
8. **#070** — Schedule view re-renders the same week 6× — no date variance.
9. **#082** — Settings → Profile dumps 230+ avatar/icon buttons with no search or grouping.
10. **#092** — Status pill says "All Systems Running" while the daemon is in fact down (optimistic UI).

## Themes

1. **Optimistic UI hides real failures.** Status, save state, and stars badge all show stale or wrong info before reality lands.
2. **Routes are inconsistent.** Two URL taxonomies coexist (`#/page/...` and `#/cabinet/./...`), and only one deep-links.
3. **Surface area outpaces affordance.** The status bar, toolbar, settings page, and avatar picker each carry too much in one row.
4. **Modals trap focus poorly.** Disclaimer + tour stack on top of each other; aria-hidden ancestors hold focused descendants.
5. **Copy is loose.** Mixed casing, repeating CTAs, vague verbs ("Mute"), undefined nouns ("Heartbeat" explained 2× but never on first use).
6. **Skills + provider story is invisible from the UI.** Half the agent value depends on `~/.cabinet/skills/` and CLI installs that have no in-app onboarding.

## Walkthrough — what a new user sees

1. **First load** — full-page disclaimer modal (long legal copy). Behind it, a tour modal stacks on top of the homescreen. Two modals + a not-yet-rendered chrome. Confusing first impression. (#006-#011)
2. **Homescreen** — "Good afternoon, Hila." plus a single example prompt and a row of pre-made cabinet templates. Status bar at the bottom is dense (status pill, uncommitted count, pull, replay tour, Discord, GitHub, stars). (#012-#020)
3. **Editor** — Top toolbar, source toggle, AI side panel CTA. Save state is shown in the status bar; "Save failed" sometimes lingers. Slash menu and bubble menu work. (#031-#046)
4. **Agents** — Sidebar lists the 5 default agents. Clicking an agent name in the sidebar lands on the agents *index*, not the agent — only by clicking the card on the index page does the detail page open. Agent detail mixes inline persona editing, a live preview of the same persona, the schedule, and the chat — long single-column scroll. (#047-#060)
5. **Tasks** — Kanban (Inbox / Your Turn / Running / Just Finished / Archive) with one demo task. Drawer opens to a transcript; "Enlarge" full-takes-over the area. Schedule view duplicates the same week 6×. (#061-#075)
6. **Search** — Cmd+K opens a clean dialog but no recent items, no snippets, no fuzzy ranking insight. (#076-#081)
7. **Settings** — 9 tabs. Profile is the longest by far because it lists 230+ avatar + fallback-icon buttons. Skills is empty in this fresh cabinet. (#082-#091)
8. **Status bar / footer** — collects 7 affordances; the status pill is the most important one and is buried among them. (#092-#096)
9. **Terminal** — `Cmd+`` toggle works, but in this audit it didn't visibly open within the viewport. (#127)

## Suggested next steps

1. **Triage P0/P1 in a single sprint.** 23 issues, mostly UI rendering bugs and trust-eroding "lying" status indicators.
2. **Run a 5-second test** on the disclaimer + tour combo with 5 users — almost certainly the worst part of the first impression.
3. **Pick one URL taxonomy and migrate.** The current dual scheme will rot and break Electron deep links.
4. **Hire an a11y pass.** ~10 findings here are accessibility regressions — bottle them into one ticket and run axe on every primary surface.
5. **Set a "no-lies" rule.** Status indicators, save state, and external counts must reflect ground truth or be marked as stale.

— End of index. See `issues/` for the per-finding pages.
