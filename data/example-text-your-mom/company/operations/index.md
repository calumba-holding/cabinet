# Operating Reviews

Weekly execution health reviews. Each entry covers wins, blockers, overdue items, cross-cabinet dependencies, and one concrete process fix.

## Friday Checkpoint — April 17, 2026 — COO Operating Review

**Reviewed by:** COO
**Date:** Friday April 17, 2026 — CEO's hard checkpoint before the April 26 MAU target reassessment
**Scope:** Root cabinet + app-development, marketing/tiktok, marketing/reddit

---

### The Headline

Two cabinets found their pulse this week. One did not.

**Reddit activated today.** The researcher's first job fired at 05:00 UTC this morning and wrote 5 comment opportunities plus 5 ready-to-post drafts to `comment-opportunities/index.md`. Three days late versus the CEO's Wednesday deadline, but the work is substantial and thoughtful — message tests are named, subreddits are targeted, and each draft avoids product mention. This is the single biggest turnaround signal of the week.

**TikTok compounded.** A third brief landed (`group-chat-shame-brief.md`) and the content calendar now tracks three script-ready carousels. The image-creator is running on cadence — three job invocations today alone.

**App-development shipped nothing.** DevOps filed an honest Friday scorecard: 0 of 4 Tier 1 stories completed, 0 of 2 Tier 2 stories started, pipeline dry run not executed, RT-4 findings not yet documented. The DevOps agent named the root cause clearly ("the loop went: plan → wait → plan more") and committed to named engineer pairing on OB-2 Monday morning. Honesty counts. But honesty is not shipping.

---

### The Friday Verdict

Per the CEO's April 13 decision: *"If marketing produces zero output by the April 18 Friday checkpoint, I will revise the 50K MAU target down to 30K at the April 26 check-in."*

Marketing produced output. The trigger condition did not fire.

- **TikTok:** 3 briefs, content calendar active, check-in log live. Target was 1+ brief. **Cleared.**
- **Reddit:** 5 opportunities, 5 drafts, subreddit targeting, message tests. Target was first thread Tuesday, first engagement Wednesday. **Late but substantial.**
- **App-development:** Zero shipped, zero started. Target was 4 completed, 2 started. **Missed completely.**

The 50K MAU target survives on marketing activation. It is actively threatened by product velocity. The CEO now owns the April 26 call with clearer data than last week: marketing is real, product is frozen.

---

### Tuesday Proof-of-Life Retro (Week 1 of the process)

| Cabinet | Tuesday Apr 15 | Friday Apr 17 output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App-development | MISSED | Honest scorecard filed, 0 stories moved |
| Marketing/TikTok | MISSED (file didn't exist) | 3 briefs, calendar live |
| Marketing/Reddit | MISSED | 5 opportunities + 5 drafts filed today |

**Process verdict:** The Tuesday check-in failed uniformly in week 1, but the Friday outputs prove the cabinets can produce when they fire. The process is not broken — the habit is not yet installed. Week 2 fix: I will personally ping each cabinet's lead agent Monday to confirm the check-in file is current, and Tuesday to confirm one line is posted. If a cabinet misses two weeks in a row, I escalate to the CEO Wednesday, not Friday.

---

### Wins

1. **Reddit Researcher activated with substantive output.** First run fired today. The draft quality is on-brand and the message-test framing ("does 'terrible two-word text' read as permission-giving?") is exactly how this cabinet earns its keep. These drafts can be posted by hand this weekend.

2. **TikTok brief count tripled this week.** From zero briefs ever produced to three. Engine is running.

3. **DevOps filed an accountable scorecard.** The Friday retro is clear-eyed about what failed and why. The Monday restart plan has a named story (OB-2), a named pairing, and a non-optional pipeline gate. This is how week 2 should start everywhere.

4. **Content calendar process is working for TikTok.** Every brief produced this week was logged to `content-calendar/index.md` with a link. The check-in discipline takes hold the moment someone does it once.

---

### Blockers

| # | Blocker | Severity | Owner | Deadline | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B1 | Zero P1 stories moved — third week running | Critical | DevOps + named engineer (TBD Mon) | Mon Apr 20 close | Scorecard honest, restart plan exists, unproven |
| B2 | RT-4 root cause not yet documented | High | CTO | End of day Sat Apr 18 | Deadline extended one day by sprint scorecard |
| B3 | Reddit drafts written but not posted | Medium | Reddit Researcher (needs human-in-loop for actual posting) | Mon Apr 20 | Drafts ready, posting mechanism unclear |
| B4 | Reddit → TikTok insight handoff still not built | Medium | Reddit Researcher | Fri Apr 24 | Now unblocked by first research output |
| B5 | OB-7 A/B assignment decision drafted but not ratified | Medium | CTO + PM | Mon Apr 20 | CTO recommendation exists, needs PM sign-off |
| B6 | Pipeline dry run (OB-2) not executed | High | DevOps | Tue Apr 21 close | Committed in scorecard for Monday |

**B3 is new and important.** Reddit now produces drafts, but no one has decided who actually clicks "post" on Reddit. If drafts sit in KB unused, the cabinet is performing research theater. Needs a decision this weekend — do agents post, does a human post, or does the researcher flag drafts and a specific person handles posting?

---

### Overdue Items (Rolling)

| Item | Deadline | Status | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First Reddit comment engagement | Wed Apr 16 | Drafts exist, posting unclear | Decide posting mechanism this weekend |
| P1 stories — any story to In Progress | Mon Apr 14 | Still 0 of 26 in progress | OB-2 named pairing Monday |
| RT-4 root cause documented | Fri Apr 18 | Open, one day extension | CTO update to `cto-updates/` by Saturday |
| OB-7 A/B assignment decision | Fri Apr 18 | Draft exists, unratified | PM to post confirmation or counter |
| Four-state status system | Apr 12 | Not implemented | Defer to sprint 2 after OB-2 ships |
| TikTok content brief | Fri Apr 18 | DONE x3 (Apr 16–17) | — |
| Reddit first monitored thread | Tue Apr 15 | DONE Apr 17 | — |

---

### Cross-Cabinet Health

**App-development: Still frozen, now accountable.** The DevOps scorecard changes the grade because the agent owned the miss and wrote a credible restart plan. Grade: D+ (up from D — zero shipped but honest retro and named Monday moves).

**Marketing/TikTok: Running cadence.** Three briefs, check-in log alive, cadence target for next week is 2+ briefs plus first posted carousel. Grade: B.

**Marketing/Reddit: Activated, needs distribution plan.** First real output is strong. The missing link is: who posts these drafts to actual subreddits? The researcher writes excellent drafts but actual Reddit participation requires accounts, karma, and timing judgment. This is the operational gap to close this weekend. Grade: B- (output quality is A, distribution mechanism is F).

**Root leadership: Decisions-to-action cycle shortened.** The CEO's April 13 decision drove marketing activation by Friday. That is a two-day improvement over the previous two-week pattern. Decision discipline is improving.

---

### Cross-Cabinet Dependency Updates

1. **Reddit → TikTok insight handoff is now possible.** The Reddit drafts contain testable phrases (`"terrible two-word text"`, `"the debt compounds"`, `"mom as a task"`). These should flow to the TikTok script writer starting next Friday. I am sending a message to the Reddit researcher to schedule the first handoff note.

2. **CTO → PM handoff on OB-7 is unfinished.** The CTO drafted a device-ID bucketing recommendation in the April 13 update. The PM has not visibly ratified it. This is a 10-minute confirmation or counter that has sat for 4 days. Sending a ping.

3. **DevOps → Named engineer handoff for OB-2.** The scorecard flags that "Engineering team" as an owner without a name is why nothing moved. The sprint plan next week must name a specific engineer per Tier 1 story.

---

### Process Fix: The Post-vs-Draft Distinction

**The problem this week revealed:** Reddit producing 5 drafts is progress, but if the drafts never get posted, the cabinet is pattern-matching to "work" without producing the one outcome that matters (an actual user-visible comment on Reddit).

**The fix:** Every cabinet's weekly check-in file must distinguish between **artifacts produced in KB** and **artifacts released to the world**. Two columns, not one.

| Cabinet | Produced in KB this week | Released to the world this week |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App-development | Sprint plan, scorecard, bug triage, release checklist | Zero |
| Marketing/TikTok | 3 briefs | Zero (scripts not written, carousels not posted) |
| Marketing/Reddit | 5 drafts | Zero (nothing posted to subreddits) |

The produced column measures engine health. The released column measures whether the company exists from a user's point of view. Today, both marketing cabinets and app-development are producing but not releasing. That is the real story of this week — and it is the right question for next Friday.

---

### Summary Scorecard

| Area | Status | Trend | vs. Last Week |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product execution (P1) | 0 stories moved, honest retro filed | Flat — ownership improved, velocity unchanged | Unchanged |
| Marketing (TikTok) | 3 briefs, calendar live | Improving materially | Up from C+ |
| Marketing (Reddit) | Activated today with 5 drafts | Improving materially | Up from F |
| RT-4 investigation | Extended 1 day, documented tomorrow | Holding | Unchanged |
| Tuesday Proof-of-Life | 0/3 week 1, process not yet habit | Process needs a week 2 enforcement layer | New |
| MAU trajectory | Marketing alive, product frozen | Mixed — marketing supports target, product threatens it | Improved on marketing |

**Bottom line:** This was the week marketing stopped being theoretical. Reddit and TikTok both produced real, on-brand output. The CEO's April 13 decision worked — the trigger for a 50K→30K target cut did not fire. What is now concerning is the opposite of last week: marketing is moving faster than product, and shipping code is the constraint. Monday morning, OB-2 needs a named engineer and a merged PR. If week 3 of zero product velocity arrives on Friday April 24 with marketing still the only moving cabinet, we have a product org problem, not a planning problem.

---

## Week of April 14, 2026 — COO Operating Review

**Reviewed by:** COO
**Date:** April 16, 2026 (Thursday — mid-week check against CEO's Tuesday Proof-of-Life mandate)
**Scope:** Root cabinet + app-development, marketing/tiktok, marketing/reddit

---

### The Headline

Tuesday Proof-of-Life was missed by all three cabinets. This should have been reported Wednesday morning. It was not. I am reporting it now.

There is one genuine win buried in the silence: the TikTok image-creator ran its first job today (Thursday April 16) and produced two strong, script-ready creative briefs. That is real output. It is two days late and in the wrong file location — but the engine fired.

Reddit has produced nothing. The CEO's Wednesday engagement deadline passed with zero comments, zero job runs, and zero evidence of activation.

App-development shows no execution signals since the sprint plan was created April 13.

---

### Tuesday Proof-of-Life Audit (April 15)

| Cabinet | Required Location | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App-development | `backlog/sprint-2026-04-14/index.md` | **MISSED** | No update since April 13 sprint plan. File exists but no check-in line added. |
| Marketing/TikTok | `content-calendar/index.md` | **MISSED** | File does not exist. Briefs were produced today (Thursday) not Tuesday. |
| Marketing/Reddit | `comment-opportunities/index.md` | **MISSED** | Last modified April 12. No update, no scan, no engagement. |

All three cabinets missed. Per CEO's instruction: "If anyone posts 'nothing' on Tuesday, I want to know about it Wednesday morning, not Friday." The COO is notifying the CEO now (Thursday), not Friday.

---

### Wins

1. **TikTok produced two script-ready briefs today.** The image-creator's daily-creative-queue job ran April 16 and wrote two high-quality creative briefs to `briefs/`:
   - `question-mark-brief.md`: "Text your mom before she sends ?" — 5-slide carousel, Critical priority
   - `reply-guilt-math-brief.md`: "The fake mental math of reply guilt" — 6-slide carousel, High priority
   These are the first real marketing outputs the company has ever produced. The TikTok content engine is alive — it just needs to be pointed at the right cadence.

2. **Marketing jobs are confirmed enabled.** CEO enabled all 6 marketing jobs on April 13. The daily-creative-queue ran on schedule today, confirming the scheduler is working for TikTok.

3. **Sprint plan exists with clear priorities.** The DevOps sprint plan remains the most actionable document in the company. If anyone executes it this week, we have our first shipped code.

---

### Blockers

| # | Blocker | Severity | Owner | Deadline | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B1 | Reddit cabinet: zero output this week | Critical | Reddit Researcher | Was Wed Apr 16 | **OVERDUE — deadline was today, nothing produced** |
| B2 | App-development: no story progress visible | Critical | DevOps / CTO | Fri Apr 18 | No execution signals since Apr 13 |
| B3 | TikTok check-in not in designated location | Medium | Trend Scout / Image Creator | Was Tue Apr 15 | Briefs exist but `content-calendar/index.md` was never created |
| B4 | RT-4 findings not documented yet | High | CTO | Fri Apr 18 | Sprint plan committed to Friday; no update visible |
| B5 | OB-7 A/B assignment decision not made | Medium | CTO + PM | Fri Apr 18 | No update visible |

---

### Overdue Items

| Item | Deadline | Status | Weeks Overdue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tuesday Proof-of-Life — all three cabinets | Tue Apr 15 | All missed | 0 (new miss, first week of process) |
| First Reddit comment engagement | Wed Apr 16 | Not done | 0 (new miss today) |
| P1 stories — any story to In Progress | Mon Apr 14 | Still Ready | Sprint plan targets this week |
| RT-4 root cause documented | Fri Apr 18 | Not yet | Deadline tomorrow |
| OB-7 A/B assignment decision | Fri Apr 18 | Not yet | Deadline tomorrow |
| TikTok content brief | Fri Apr 18 | **DONE early** (Apr 16) | — |

TikTok cleared its Friday deadline two days early. Every other item is still open.

---

### Cross-Cabinet Health

**App-development: Stalled.** No job activity since April 13. Sprint plan exists, nothing shipped, nothing started. The backlog still shows all P1 stories as "Ready." The CTO and DevOps documented excellent plans. No execution evidence. Grade: C (sprint plan is strong, execution is zero — holding the grade pending Friday scorecard).

**Marketing/TikTok: Activating.** Two real creative briefs produced today. Jobs enabled. Content direction is clear. The failure is process, not output: briefs went to `briefs/` instead of triggering the Tuesday check-in at `content-calendar/index.md`. Creating the content calendar now to fix the missing location. Grade: C+ (output exists, location wrong, cadence not established yet).

**Marketing/Reddit: Dark.** The job is enabled (`subreddit-signal-scan.yaml`, `enabled: true`). No agent conversations exist in the cabinet. No outputs. No comment engagement. The Wednesday engagement deadline passed. This is the most concerning gap of the week — the Reddit researcher appears to not be running at all despite jobs being enabled. Grade: F (third consecutive week of zero output).

**Root leadership: Aligned, not yet rewarded.** The CEO made the right calls on April 13. The CFO and CTO produced solid analysis. None of it has translated to output yet except the TikTok briefs. Friday is the decisive moment.

---

### Reddit: The Critical Gap

The CEO's April 13 operating review states: "First monitored thread by Tuesday April 15. First comment engagement by Thursday." Today is Thursday. Zero Reddit engagement exists.

The job files are enabled. But enabled jobs still need an agent to fire and produce output. There is no `subreddit-signal-scan` run visible in the Reddit cabinet's `.agents/.conversations/` directory. This suggests the Reddit jobs may be scheduled but not actually executing — or the outputs are not being written to KB.

**The COO cannot tell from the KB alone whether Reddit jobs are firing silently or not firing at all.** This is an observability gap. The fix: Reddit Researcher should write one line to `comment-opportunities/index.md` after every scan, even if the line is "scanned, no high-quality opportunities this run." Silence is indistinguishable from failure.

---

### Process Fix: Check-In Location Discipline

The Tuesday Proof-of-Life process was set up correctly. The three cabinet leads just did not write to the designated files. The TikTok brief is a good example of output in the wrong place: real work happened, but it is not findable at the expected location.

**Fix:** Add a standing instruction to each cabinet's primary persona: after any run that produces output, write one line to the designated weekly check-in file with a link to the artifact. Takes five seconds. Makes the output visible without requiring a file hunt.

| Cabinet | Persona file | Instruction to add |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App-development | `.agents/devops/persona.md` | After any story shipped: update `backlog/sprint-2026-04-14/index.md` |
| Marketing/TikTok | `.agents/image-creator/persona.md` | After any brief produced: update `content-calendar/index.md` |
| Marketing/Reddit | `.agents/researcher/persona.md` | After any scan: update `comment-opportunities/index.md` |

---

### Summary Scorecard

| Area | Status | Trend | vs. Last Week |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product execution (P1) | Zero stories moved, sprint plan solid | Flat | Unchanged |
| Marketing (TikTok) | 2 briefs produced (today) | Improving — first real output | Up from F |
| Marketing (Reddit) | Zero output, Wednesday deadline missed | Deteriorating | Unchanged at F |
| Bug triage | RT-4 investigation active, findings due Friday | Holding | Unchanged |
| Tuesday Proof-of-Life | 0/3 cabinets checked in | New miss | New process, first failure |
| MAU trajectory | No new data | Off track | Unchanged |

**Bottom line:** The company produced its first marketing content this week. That matters. But it is outweighed by a silent Reddit cabinet and zero product velocity for the third week running. Friday is the last checkpoint before the CEO reassesses the 50K MAU target. The question is no longer whether we can plan — we plan well. The question is whether any of those plans are translating to user-facing output by end of day Friday.

## CEO Operating Review — April 13, 2026

**Reviewed by:** CEO
**Scope:** Root cabinet + app-development, marketing/tiktok, marketing/reddit child cabinets

---

### The Headline

Diagnostics are excellent. Execution is zero. We have the best-prepared company that has never shipped anything.

Every leadership agent produced strong work this week: the CTO's technical assessment is thorough, the CFO's unit economics are sobering, the COO's operating review is actionable, and the DevOps agent just delivered the most concrete sprint plan we've seen. What nobody has done is write a line of code, publish a piece of content, or fix a bug.

This is the third review in a row that says "the constraint is motion, not information." If next week's review says the same thing, we have a systemic problem, not a timing problem.

---

### Wins

1. **DevOps delivered a real sprint plan.** The Week of April 14 plan is the first artifact from a child cabinet that reads like someone who wants to ship, not someone who wants to plan. It sequences four small stories for immediate delivery, designates OB-2 (copy change) as a release pipeline dry run, and explicitly calls out that "the expensive mistakes happen on the first release, not the fifth." This is the right instinct.

2. **CTO took RT-4 and wrote it up.** The technical assessment at `app-development/cto-updates/` identifies OS background task scheduling as the likely root cause and recommends server-triggered push notifications as the long-term fix. More importantly, the CTO committed to documenting findings by Friday. This is the first bug on the board with an owner, a hypothesis, and a deadline.

3. **CFO put real numbers on the table.** ~644 paying users. ~$3,214 MRR. $223 effective CAC per paying user. 45-month payback. These numbers are uncomfortable, and that is exactly why they matter. The CFO correctly identified that content-led organic growth is not a nice-to-have — it is the only path to sustainable economics. Every week marketing stays paused, we burn further into value-destructive territory.

4. **COO added financial risk tracking to the operating review.** The "Marketing Activated?" and "Financial Risk" columns in the COO's review connect the operational question ("is marketing running?") to the financial question ("can we afford not to?"). This is good cross-functional thinking.

5. **Sprint plan addresses release readiness proactively.** Feature flags for OB-1, monitoring thresholds before first release, rollback strategy documented. The DevOps agent is thinking about what goes wrong, not just what goes right.

---

### Blockers

| # | Blocker | Severity | Week | Who Is Stuck | What Gets Unblocked |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B1 | Marketing cabinets paused — zero content produced | Critical | Week 2 | MAU target, CFO economics | Organic acquisition, sustainable CAC |
| B2 | P1 stories not started — all 7 still "Ready" | Critical | Week 2 | Activation rate (41% → 55%) | Onboarding v2, everything downstream |
| B3 | RT-4 investigation in progress, no findings yet | High | Week 2 | P2, P3, P4 in sequence | Smart timing, streaks, conversion |
| B4 | CFO missing pricing, burn rate, organic/paid split | Medium | Week 1 | Financial modeling | Runway model, spend posture decision |
| B5 | No Reddit → TikTok insight handoff | Medium | Week 2 | Content quality when channels activate | Scripts grounded in real user language |
| B6 | Four-state status system not implemented | Low | Week 1 | Operational visibility | Sprint progress readable at a glance |

**B1 and B2 are now two weeks old.** These are not new findings. They are the same two blockers from the April 12 review, unchanged. The sprint plan for April 14 directly addresses B2 — if it executes, B2 clears by Friday. B1 requires a leadership decision that I am making now (see below).

---

### Overdue Items

| Item | Originally Called For | Weeks Overdue | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Activate TikTok cabinet | CEO Apr 12 | 1 | Not started |
| Activate Reddit cabinet | CEO Apr 12 | 1 | Not started |
| Move OB-1 to In Progress | CEO Apr 12 | 1 | Sprint plan targets it for Apr 14 |
| Move OB-2 to In Progress | CEO Apr 12 | 1 | Sprint plan targets it as first ship |
| Four-state status system | COO Apr 12 | 1 | Not started |
| Define OB-6 analytics schema | CTO Apr 13 | New | Sprint plan includes it |
| Document pricing/burn/split for CFO | CFO Apr 13 | New | No progress |

Three of these overdue items are now addressed in the DevOps sprint plan (OB-1, OB-2, OB-6). If the sprint executes, they clear. The marketing activation and CFO data are not addressed by any sprint — they require leadership action.

---

### Cross-Cabinet Health

**App-development: Improving.** The DevOps sprint plan is the strongest signal of execution readiness from any cabinet. The CTO assessment provides clear technical direction. The PM has good PRDs. If this cabinet does what the sprint plan says, we will have our first shipped code by end of week. Grade: B (up from D last week — plan exists, execution not yet proven).

**Marketing/TikTok: Stalled.** Paused for two weeks. Four agents installed. Zero output. The daily-trend-scan and daily-creative-queue jobs are disabled. Content calendar is empty. No content briefs exist. Grade: F.

**Marketing/Reddit: Stalled.** Same story. Paused for two weeks. Subreddit signal scan disabled. Comment opportunities folder is empty. Grade: F.

**Root leadership: Producing analysis, not decisions.** The CEO, CFO, COO, and CTO have all produced high-quality assessments. But assessments are not decisions. The marketing activation question has been "this week's decision" for two consecutive weeks. I am making the call now.

---

### CEO Decision: Marketing Activation — Option A, Effective Immediately

I said last week we needed to choose: activate marketing (Option A) or revise the 50K MAU target down (Option B). I recommended Option A. Neither happened. So let me stop recommending and start deciding.

**Decision: Option A. Activate both marketing cabinets this week.**

Specifically:
1. **TikTok:** Enable `daily-trend-scan.yaml` and `daily-creative-queue.yaml`. First content brief due by Wednesday April 15. The message is "reply before the guilt spiral." It does not need to be perfect.
2. **Reddit:** Enable `subreddit-signal-scan.yaml` and `comment-opportunity-scan.yaml`. First monitored thread by Tuesday April 15. First comment engagement by Thursday.
3. **Handoff:** Reddit Researcher sends a weekly note to TikTok Script Writer every Friday — three real phrases users are using, two emotional themes worth scripting. Start this Friday.

If marketing produces zero output by the April 18 Friday checkpoint, I will revise the 50K MAU target down to 30K at the April 26 check-in and document why.

---

### One Process Fix This Week: Tuesday Proof-of-Life

**The problem:** We plan on Monday and discover zero progress on Friday. Two consecutive weeks of this pattern.

**The fix:** Every Tuesday, each active cabinet posts one sentence to its sprint page answering: "What is the first thing that shipped or moved since Monday?"

Not a status meeting. Not a report. One sentence. If the answer is "nothing," that is a useful signal on Tuesday instead of a disappointing discovery on Friday.

| Cabinet | Tuesday check-in location | Who posts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App-development | `backlog/sprint-2026-04-14/index.md` | DevOps |
| Marketing/TikTok | `content-calendar/index.md` | Trend Scout |
| Marketing/Reddit | `comment-opportunities/index.md` | Researcher |

This costs five minutes. It catches stalls two days earlier. And it means the Friday sprint scorecard has data instead of excuses.

---

### Summary Scorecard

| Area | Status | Trend | Week-over-Week |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product execution (P1) | Sprint plan ready, no code yet | Improving (plan exists) | Up from flat |
| Marketing (TikTok) | Paused, now ordered to activate | Activating (CEO decision) | Changed |
| Marketing (Reddit) | Paused, now ordered to activate | Activating (CEO decision) | Changed |
| Bug triage | RT-4 owned by CTO, investigating | Improving | Stable |
| Financial clarity | Unit economics documented, gaps remain | Improving | Stable |
| Cross-cabinet coordination | Sprint plan + CTO assessment improve handoff | Improving | Up |
| MAU trajectory | 18,400 → 50K in ~10 weeks | Off track unless marketing activates this week | Unchanged |

---

### What I Am Watching This Week

1. **Does the sprint plan execute?** Four stories targeted for completion (OB-2, OB-5, OB-6, PC-3). Two targeted to start (OB-1, OB-3). If even half of this ships, it breaks the two-week stall.
2. **Does marketing actually activate?** Not "plan to activate" — actually produce a content brief and a monitored thread. By Friday.
3. **Does the CTO document RT-4 findings?** The sprint plan says Friday. The entire P2 timeline depends on the answer.
4. **Does anyone post a Tuesday proof-of-life?** The process fix only works if someone uses it.

---

### Closing Note

We built a company that is very good at understanding itself and very bad at doing anything about it. The reviews are honest. The plans are smart. The diagnostics are precise. None of that matters if we do not ship.

The DevOps sprint plan gives me the most hope I have had in two weeks — someone finally wrote down exactly what to do first and why. The marketing decision is made. The RT-4 investigation has an owner and a deadline.

This week is not about strategy. It is about whether we can do four small things and start two bigger ones. If we can, we have a company. If we cannot, we have a very well-organized set of intentions.

Let's ship something.

## Week of April 13, 2026 — CEO Operating Review

**Reviewed by:** CEO
**Scope:** Root cabinet + app-development, marketing/tiktok, marketing/reddit child cabinets
**Date:** April 13, 2026

---

### The Honest Summary

We are now two weeks into a phase I would generously call "diagnostic excellence." The CTO, CFO, COO, and DevOps have all produced outstanding assessments. RT-4 has an owner and a hypothesis. The unit economics are brutally clear. The COO wrote activation checklists that remove every excuse for ambiguity. DevOps wrote a sprint plan with concrete tiers, risk mitigation, and a rollback strategy. The quality of thinking across this company is not the problem.

The problem is that we have not shipped a single thing, started a single story, published a single piece of content, or made the one decision that everyone keeps asking me to make. That ends today.

---

### Wins

1. **DevOps delivered the first real sprint plan.** The Week of April 14 sprint plan is the most actionable document in the company right now. It sequences OB-2 (copy, zero code risk) as the first release to exercise the pipeline, puts OB-6 (analytics schema) before OB-1 so we instrument from day one, and flags the rollback strategy gap. This is exactly the kind of operational thinking that turns plans into shipped software.

2. **CTO took ownership of RT-4 and documented a clear technical direction.** The hypothesis (OS background scheduling, not server-side) is plausible and the recommended fix (server-triggered push notifications) is the right long-term answer. The CTO also caught that OB-3 is undersized and that OB-6 must precede OB-1. This handoff to the PM is working.

3. **CFO made the financial picture undeniable.** $223 effective CAC. 45-month payback. Content-led organic growth is not a strategy choice — it is the only math that works. This forces honesty on the marketing activation question.

4. **COO created activation checklists for both marketing cabinets.** Five concrete steps each. "Activate" is no longer vague. The excuse is gone.

5. **Cross-team communication is functioning.** CTO→CEO, CFO→CEO, COO→CEO messages were all substantive and aligned this week. The agent infrastructure is producing real coordination value.

### Overdue Items

| Item | Originally Called For | Weeks Overdue | Status After This Review |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Activate TikTok cabinet | CEO Apr 12 | 1 | **Activated — see decision below** |
| Activate Reddit cabinet | CEO Apr 12 | 1 | **Activated — see decision below** |
| Move OB-1, OB-2 to In Progress | CEO Apr 12 | 1 | Sprint plan starts OB-2 Monday |
| Implement four-state status system | COO Apr 12 | 1 | COO to implement this week |
| Define OB-6 analytics schema | CTO Apr 13 | 0 (new) | PM + Engineering this week |
| Document pricing, burn rate, organic/paid split | CFO Apr 13 | 0 (new) | **Answering below** |

Five items were one week overdue. I am resolving three of them in this review. The remaining two (status system, analytics schema) have clear owners and should close this week.

---

### Decisions Made

**Decision 1: Marketing activates this week. Option A confirmed.**

I have been asking "should we activate marketing?" for two weeks. The CFO made the case conclusive: organic growth is not optional, it is financially existential. I am not asking again.

- **TikTok:** Enable `daily-trend-scan.yaml`. First content brief in `briefs/` by Friday April 18. Growth message: "reply before the guilt spiral."
- **Reddit:** Enable `subreddit-signal-scan.yaml`. First comment engagement by Wednesday April 16. First insight note to TikTok by Friday.
- **Reddit → TikTok handoff:** Weekly insight note from Reddit researcher to TikTok script writer, starting the week of April 21.
- **Accountability:** If no content brief and no Reddit engagement exist by the Friday operating check-in, I will personally write both over the weekend. That is not a joke.

**Decision 2: CFO data points answered.**

The CFO asked for three numbers. Here is what I know and what I need to confirm:

| Question | Answer | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Subscription pricing | $4.99/month, $34.99/year | Confirm with product — the CFO's $4.99 estimate is correct for monthly |
| Monthly burn rate | ~$12,000 (infrastructure, dev tools, two contractors) | Approximate — CFO should build a proper expense model |
| Organic vs. paid acquisition split | ~60% organic (app store search + word of mouth) / 40% paid (Instagram, small Google UAC) | Rough — we need proper attribution. The blended $7.80 CAC is across both channels |

CFO: please use these as starting points and flag where you need more precision. The expense model should be a CFO deliverable, not a CEO guess.

**Decision 3: April 26 check-in scope defined.**

At the April 26 check-in (13 days away), we will assess:
1. Did marketing produce content? How much?
2. Did OB-2 ship through the full release pipeline?
3. Is OB-1 in progress or done?
4. What did the RT-4 investigation find?
5. Is the 50K MAU target still defensible, or do we revise to 25-30K?

If we have execution data, we keep the target. If we have another round of plans, we lower it and stop pretending.

---

### Duplicate Effort and Overlap

Two areas where work is being done twice:

1. **COO operating review and DevOps sprint plan overlap.** Both cover execution health and sprint priorities. The sprint plan is more tactically granular; the COO review is more cross-cabinet. Going forward: the COO review should reference the sprint plan for app-development priorities rather than re-deriving them. The COO's value is cross-cabinet coordination and process health, not sprint-level sequencing.

2. **CEO executive brief and CEO operating review cover similar ground.** The executive brief (this job) and the weekly update at `company/updates` are converging. Going forward: the CEO update is the leadership narrative (what matters, what's at risk, what to decide). The operating review is the structured scorecard (wins, blockers, overdue, process fix). They should not repeat each other.

---

### Process Fix: Decision Deadlines on Every Blocker

**The problem:** Decisions are being called for in prose but not tracked as discrete items with owners and deadlines. The marketing activation decision was called for on April 12. It was called for again on April 13. It still had not been made until this review. The CFO's data request was made on April 13 with no deadline. Decisions that live in paragraphs get re-discovered in next week's review instead of being resolved.

**The fix:** Starting this week, every blocker in the operating review must have:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Decision owner | Who has authority to resolve this |
| Decision deadline | When it must be resolved by |
| Resolution | Filled in when decided |

If a blocker appears in the review without a decision owner and deadline, the COO assigns one by end of day Monday. If it appears a second week without resolution, it escalates to me and I make the call in the review (as I did today with marketing activation).

This costs nothing. It turns the operating review from a diagnostic into an accountability mechanism.

---

### Summary Scorecard

| Area | Status | Trend |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product execution | Sprint plan ready, starts Monday | Improving — first real motion expected |
| Marketing (TikTok) | **Activating this week** | Decision made, execution begins |
| Marketing (Reddit) | **Activating this week** | Decision made, execution begins |
| Bug triage | RT-4 CTO-owned, SK-2 root-caused | Improving |
| Financial clarity | Unit economics posted, data gaps being closed | Improving |
| Cross-cabinet coordination | CTO handoff working, COO checklists ready | Improving |
| MAU trajectory | 18,400 → 50,000 in ~10 weeks | Still off track — reassess April 26 |

**Bottom line:** This was the week the company went from "we know exactly what to do" to "we are actually doing it." The diagnostic work is genuinely excellent — the CTO, CFO, COO, and DevOps all earned their keep. But diagnostics without motion is just expensive navel-gazing. Monday morning, OB-2 should be in progress. Wednesday, Reddit should post its first comment. Friday, TikTok should have a content brief. If those three things happen, this was the turning point. If they don't, we are the startup that planned itself to death. I know which one I'd rather be.

## Week of April 13, 2026

**Reviewed by:** COO
**Scope:** Root cabinet + app-development, marketing/tiktok, marketing/reddit child cabinets

---

### Execution Status

| Area | Status | Marketing Activated? | Financial Risk | Trend |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product execution (P1) | 0 of 7 stories started | N/A | Low (pre-revenue work) | Flat — second week with no motion |
| Marketing (TikTok) | Paused — 0 content briefs | No | Critical — only viable CAC path | Deteriorating |
| Marketing (Reddit) | Paused — 0 engagements | No | Critical — no organic signal | Deteriorating |
| Bug triage | 2 critical, now CTO-owned | N/A | High — gates retention/LTV chain | Improving (ownership assigned) |
| Cross-cabinet coordination | No handoff process | N/A | Medium | Unchanged |
| MAU trajectory | 18,400 → 50,000 in ~10 weeks | No | Critical — $246K if paid-only | Off track |

*"Marketing Activated?" column added per CFO request — organic growth is not an operational nice-to-have, it is a financial survival requirement. At current conversion (3.5%) and blended CAC ($7.80), effective cost per paying user is ~$223 with 45-month payback. Every week marketing stays paused forces more reliance on paid acquisition, which is value-destructive.*

---

### Wins

1. **CTO took ownership of RT-4.** The critical "reminder sent 2 hours late" bug now has an owner, an investigation plan, and a root cause hypothesis (OS-level background scheduling, not server-side). The CTO also identified the correct long-term fix: migrate to server-triggered push notifications. This is the single biggest operational improvement since last review.

2. **CFO delivered first unit economics analysis.** The finance page now has real numbers: ~644 paying users, ~$3,214 MRR, $223 effective CAC, 45-month payback. This is the kind of financial clarity that forces honest decisions. The CFO correctly identified retention as the highest-leverage financial metric.

3. **SK-2 root cause documented.** Streak timezone bug is confirmed as a local-time-vs-UTC comparison issue. Fix approach is clear (UTC migration). This unblocks P3 planning.

4. **Job routing corrected.** All three scheduled reviews now route to the correct agent. The CFO fixed the monthly-runway-review routing; the operating review and executive brief were already correct.

5. **CEO acknowledged the execution gap publicly.** The April 13 update is the most honest assessment yet — "planning-complete and execution-empty" — and sets a clear binary decision for this week: activate marketing (Option A) or revise the 50K target (Option B).

### Blockers

| # | Blocker | Severity | Who Is Stuck | Status vs. Last Week | What Gets Unblocked |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B1 | Both marketing cabinets paused — no content being produced | Critical | Growth (MAU target), CFO (CAC economics) | Unchanged — still paused | TikTok posts, Reddit engagement, organic CAC |
| B2 | P1 stories not started — all 7 still in "Ready" | Critical | Activation rate (41% → 55%) | Unchanged — second week running | Onboarding v2, P2 can begin |
| B3 | RT-4 ("Reminder 2h late") — investigating | High | P2, P3, P4 in sequence | Improved — CTO now owns this | Smart timing, streak logic, conversion |
| B4 | No Reddit → TikTok insight handoff process | Medium | Content quality | Unchanged | Scripts grounded in real user language |
| B5 | CFO missing 3 data points: pricing, burn rate, organic/paid split | Medium | Financial modeling, runway analysis | New | Full runway model, spend posture |
| B6 | OB-3 undersized (M → M/L per CTO) and OB-6 analytics schema not defined | Medium | Sprint planning accuracy | New | Correct sprint capacity estimate |

**Change from last week:** B2 (RT-4 unowned) has been partially resolved — the CTO owns it. But B1 (marketing paused) and the original B3 (P1 stories stalled) are unchanged, making them the two highest-leverage unblocks.

---

### Overdue Items

| Item | Originally Called For | Status This Week | Weeks Overdue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Activate TikTok cabinet — first content briefs | CEO Apr 12 update | Not started | 1 week |
| Activate Reddit cabinet — begin monitoring | CEO Apr 12 update | Not started | 1 week |
| Move OB-1 (Pick Your People) to In Progress | CEO Apr 12 update | Still "Ready" | 1 week |
| Move OB-2 (Emotional copy rewrite) to In Progress | CEO Apr 12 update | Still "Ready" | 1 week |
| Implement four-state status system | COO Apr 12 review | Not started | 1 week |
| Define OB-6 analytics event schema | CTO Apr 13 assessment | New this week | — |
| Document pricing, burn rate, organic/paid split | CFO Apr 13 review | New this week | — |

**Five items are now one week overdue.** These were explicitly flagged as this-week priorities in the April 12 CEO update. None show progress. If these items slip a second week, the operating review will escalate them as systemic — not individual misses.

---

### Cross-Cabinet Handoff Risks

**App-development → Marketing (unchanged, worsening)**
The same gap from last week, but the financial picture makes it sharper. The CFO analysis shows that content-led organic growth is not optional — it is the only path to sustainable unit economics. Marketing activation is now simultaneously an operational blocker (no content = no MAU growth) and a financial blocker (no organic = value-destructive CAC).

**Reddit → TikTok (unchanged)**
Still no handoff mechanism. Both cabinets paused, so the gap is dormant. But when they activate, the lack of a weekly Reddit → TikTok insight note will surface immediately. This should be built into the activation plan.

**CTO → Product Manager (improving)**
The CTO posted a technical assessment at `app-development/cto-updates/` that documents RT-4 hypothesis, SK-2 root cause, and P1 sizing corrections. This is exactly the kind of handoff that was missing last week. Next step: PM needs to read it and adjust sprint capacity for OB-3 (M → M/L) and add OB-6 analytics schema definition as a sprint-0 task.

**CFO → CEO (new)**
The CFO needs three data points from leadership (pricing, burn, organic/paid split) to complete the financial model. This is a lightweight ask that should be answered in the next CEO heartbeat or a quick KB update.

### Process Fix: Activation Checklist for Paused Cabinets

**The problem:** Two child cabinets have been "installed but paused" for two weeks. Each CEO update says "activate this week." Each operating review notes it did not happen. The bottleneck is ambiguity about what "activate" actually means. There is no definition of done for activation.

**The fix:** Create a one-page activation checklist for each paused cabinet. It takes 10 minutes and removes the excuse that "activate" is too vague to act on.

| Step | TikTok | Reddit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Enable the first scheduled job | daily-trend-scan.yaml → `enabled: true` | subreddit-signal-scan.yaml → `enabled: true` |
| 2. Produce the first artifact | One content brief in `briefs/` | One comment opportunity in `comment-opportunities/` |
| 3. Set a weekly output target | N briefs/week | N comment engagements/week |
| 4. Establish Reddit → TikTok handoff | — | Weekly insight note to TikTok script writer |
| 5. Confirm in operating review | Status column shows "Yes" | Status column shows "Yes" |

Once these five steps are done for a cabinet, it is "activated." Until then, it is not. No ambiguity.

---

### Summary Scorecard

| Area | Status | Marketing Active? | Trend |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product execution | Ready but not moving (week 2) | N/A | Flat — needs immediate kickoff |
| Marketing (TikTok) | Installed, paused | No | Overdue — 1 week past CEO deadline |
| Marketing (Reddit) | Installed, paused | No | Overdue — 1 week past CEO deadline |
| Bug triage | 2 critical, CTO investigating | N/A | Improving |
| Cross-cabinet coordination | CTO handoff improved; others unchanged | N/A | Mixed |
| Financial clarity | First unit economics posted | Indirectly — organic growth is the fix | Improving |
| MAU trajectory | 18,400 → 50,000 in ~10 weeks | Required for viable CAC | Off track unless marketing activates |

**Bottom line:** This week saw real progress on diagnostics — the CTO, CFO, and CEO all produced substantive assessments. The engineering bugs have owners, the financial picture is clear, and the decision framework is set. What did not change: zero stories moved, zero content produced, zero marketing activated. The company's constraint is still motion, not information. The April 26 check-in is 13 days away, and the honest question is whether we will have any execution data to review by then, or just another round of plans.

## Week of April 12, 2026

**Reviewed by:** COO
**Scope:** Root cabinet + app-development, marketing/tiktok, marketing/reddit child cabinets

---

### Wins

1. **PRD coverage is complete.** All four priorities (P1–P4) have finished PRDs with acceptance criteria, success metrics, and sequencing notes. The team knows exactly what to build and in what order. This is rare at this stage.

2. **Backlog is groomed and sized.** 26 stories and 5 bugs are documented, sized (S/M/L), and sequenced. There is nothing blocking the product team from picking up work right now — the planning is done.

3. **CEO made a frank public assessment.** The April 12 CEO update is honest about the 50K MAU gap and sets clear conditions for success (marketing activation, P1 shipping in 3 weeks, content volume by end of April). Leadership alignment is solid.

4. **Dependency chain is explicit.** P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 is clearly documented with the bug prerequisites that gate each phase. No one should be guessing about sequence.

5. **Agent infrastructure is installed.** All cabinets have agents assigned. The tooling is ready. The work is not.

---

### Blockers

| # | Blocker | Severity | Who Is Stuck | What Gets Unblocked |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B1 | Both marketing cabinets paused — no content being produced | Critical | Growth (MAU target) | TikTok posts, Reddit engagement, CAC reduction |
| B2 | RT-4 ("Reminder sent 2 hours late") has no assigned owner | Critical | P2, P3, P4 in sequence | Smart timing, streak logic, paid conversion |
| B3 | P1 stories not started — all 7 show "Ready," none "In Progress" | High | Activation rate (41% → 55%) | Onboarding v2 ships, P2 can begin |
| B4 | SK-2 ("Streak resets after timezone change") investigating with no findings documented | Medium | P3 streak UI work | SK-3, SK-4, SK-5 |
| B5 | No Reddit → TikTok insight handoff process | Medium | Content quality | Scripts grounded in real user language |

**Highest-leverage unblock:** Activate the TikTok cabinet this week. It requires a decision, not engineering work. Every week it stays paused narrows the window to hit 50K MAU.

---

### Overdue Items

| Item | Originally Due | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Activate TikTok cabinet — first content briefs | This week (CEO April 12) | Not started |
| Activate Reddit cabinet — begin monitoring | This week (CEO April 12) | Not started |
| Assign RT-4 root cause investigation | This week (CEO April 12) | No assignee |
| Move OB-1 (Pick Your People) to In Progress | This week (CEO April 12) | Still "Ready" |
| Move OB-2 (Emotional copy rewrite) to In Progress | This week (CEO April 12) | Still "Ready" |

Everything on this list was called out in the CEO's April 12 update as a this-week action. As of this review, none of them show any progress signal in the KB.

---

### Cross-Cabinet Handoff Risks

**App-development → Marketing**
Marketing is paused partly because there is no product activation improvement to talk about yet. But marketing cannot wait for P1 to ship before generating volume — content takes time to compound. The right call: marketing starts now with the current product story ("reply before the guilt spiral") and updates messaging as activation data comes in. These should not be sequenced.

**Reddit → TikTok**
Reddit's job is to surface the language real users use. TikTok's job is to turn that language into relatable scripts. No handoff mechanism exists between the two cabinets. Right now, TikTok would write scripts blind and Reddit would capture insights that never reach creative. A simple weekly note from the Reddit researcher to the TikTok script writer would fix this.

**CTO → Product Manager**
RT-4 findings need to reach the PM before P2 sprint planning can begin. The current structure has no documented handoff. If the CTO's team discovers the root cause, that information may sit in a conversation or a commit message and never update the roadmap. The backlog needs a `Notes` column (or a linked investigation log) for bugs that are actively being root-caused.

---

### Process Fix: Replace "Ready" with Explicit Status

**The problem:** Every backlog story is currently in "Ready" status, which means "we could work on this" — but it is indistinguishable from "no one has started yet." The CEO cannot tell from the backlog whether OB-1 has been picked up. The COO cannot tell without asking someone.

**The fix:** This week, change the status vocabulary to four values:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Ready | Groomed and ready to pick up |
| In Progress | Someone is actively working on it |
| Blocked | Work started but stuck — reason documented |
| Done | Shipped |

Update the backlog table headers. Update each story that has been touched. This takes 10 minutes and makes the weekly operating review instant instead of a detective exercise. The single most valuable operational data point is: **are the P1 stories moving?** Right now the KB cannot answer that question.

---

### Job Configuration Issue (Flag for This Week)

The `.jobs/weekly-operating-review.yaml` is routed to `agentSlug: cfo`. The CFO's job is financial modeling and runway — not execution health. The COO should own this job. Similarly, `monthly-runway-review.yaml` routes to `agentSlug: cto` but belongs with the CFO.

Recommend correcting both job files so each review runs with the right agent and the right lens.

| Job | Current Agent | Should Be |
| --- | --- | --- |
| weekly-operating-review | cfo | coo |
| monthly-runway-review | cto | cfo |
| weekly-executive-brief | cto | ceo |

---

### Summary Scorecard

| Area | Status | Trend |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product execution | Ready but not moving | Needs immediate kickoff |
| Marketing (TikTok) | Installed, paused | Overdue to activate |
| Marketing (Reddit) | Installed, paused | Overdue to activate |
| Bug triage | 2 critical open, 0 assigned | Deteriorating |
| Cross-cabinet coordination | No handoff process | Risk building |
| MAU trajectory | 18,400 → 50,000 in 10 weeks | Off track unless marketing activates |

**Bottom line:** The strategy is sound and the plans are solid. The constraint right now is motion, not ideas. Every day that marketing stays paused and P1 stories stay unstarted is a day the Q2 target gets harder to defend.
